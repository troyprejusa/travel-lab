This means that consumers in Node.js applications can no longer just `require()` anything with a d3 transitive dependency, including much of Victory.\n\nTo help provide an easy path to folks still using CommonJS in their Node.js applications that consume Victory, we now provide this package to vendor in various d3-related packages.\n\n## Packages\n\nWe presently provide the following top-level libraries:\n<!-- cat packages/victory-vendor/package.json | egrep '\"d3-' | egrep -o 'd3-[^\"]*'| sor t-->\n\n- d3-ease\n- d3-interpolate\n- d3-scale\n- d3-shape\n- d3-timer\n\nThis is the total list of top and transitive libraries we vendor:\n<!-- ls packages/victory-vendor/lib-vendor | sort -->\n\n- d3-array\n- d3-color\n- d3-ease\n- d3-format\n- d3-interpolate\n- d3-path\n- d3-scale\n- d3-shape\n- d3-time\n- d3-time-format\n- d3-timer\n- internmap\n\nNote that this does _not_ include the following D3 libraries that still support CommonJS:\n\n- d3-voronoi\n\n## How it works\n\nWe provide two alternate paths and behaviors -- for ESM and CommonJS\n\n### ESM\n\nIf you do a Node.js import like:\n\n```js\nimport { interpolate } from \"victory-vendor/d3-interpolate\";\n```\n\nunder the hood it's going to just re-export and pass you through to `node_modules/d3-interpolate`, the **real** ESM library from D3.\n\n### CommonJS\n\nIf you do a Node.js import like:\n\n```js\nconst { interpolate } = require(\"victory-vendor/d3-interpolate\");\n```\n\nunder the hood it's going to will go to an alternate path that contains the transpiled version of the underlying d3 library to be found at `victory-vendor/lib-vendor/d3-interpolate/**/*.js`. This futher has internally consistent import references to other `victory-vendor/lib-vendor/<pkg-name>` paths.\n\nNote that for some tooling (like Jest) that doesn't play well with `package.json:exports` routing to this CommonJS path, we **also** output a root file in the form of `victory-vendor/d3-interpolate.js`.\n\n## Licenses\n\nThis project is released under the MIT license, but the vendor'ed in libraries include other licenses (e.g. ISC) that we enumerate in our `package.json:license` field.",
