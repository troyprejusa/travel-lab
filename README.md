## Overview

> **Note**: The deployed application is in closed alpha release, so the general public will not be able to create an account at this time. Access to the site is invite-only by the author.

Troy's Travel Lab is a collaborative travel planning app. It was created out of a frustration with the process
of planning trips with friends. Time and time again, we would create
shared calendars to track events, spreadsheets to jot down important
details, and message threads to stay in communcation regarding the
details. Troy's Travel Lab is my way of bringing these resources
together to plan a trip all in one place.
